#summary How to Build the Project


= Building with Ant =

The VMFS driver comes with an ant build file in {root}/build/build.xml

Executing ant will compile all sources, build the binary in {root}/deploy/fvmfs.jar and the documentation in {root}/javadoc.

= Eclipse =

The .classpath and .project files are included in the source code distribution.
Eclipse automatically recognizes this and properly sets up the project.
