#summary The CLI webdav command

The webdav command opens a VMFS volume, and serves the contents of the file system as WebDAV/HTTP. The volume can be directly mounted in most operating systems.

The WebDAV server binds on localhost (127.0.0.1) and port 50080 by default. This can be changed by optionally specifying the host IP and port to bind to.

== Starting the WebDAV server ==

The following command starts a WebDAV server for the VMFS volume on /dev/sda5:
{{{
>java -jar fvmfs.jar /dev/sda5 webdav

VMFSTools (C) by fluid Operations (v0.9.8.13 r66 / 2009-03-05_22-18-06)
http://www.fluidops.com

*** Serving WebDAV/HTTP at http://localhost:50080/vmfs
}}}

By pointing your Web browser to the URL, you can now browse the VMFS file system.

== Mounting the volume ==

Under Windows, this volume can now be mounted as a drive letter as follows:

{{{
> net use * http://localhost:50080/vmfs

Drive Z: is now connected to http://localhost:50080/vmfs.

The command completed successfully.
}}}

The VMFS volume is now visible under drive Z. Executing a dir Z:\ shows the root directory. Under Windows Vista and XP SP3, this should work out of the box.
